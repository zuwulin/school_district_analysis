# school_district_analysis

## Overview of Analysis
The current project was requested by a district school board overseeing 15 high school bodies to evaluate current fund allocation efficiency and make adjustments to each respective school's budget, if needed.

### Purpose
The purpose of the current analysis was, first, to examine the overall performance trends across all 15 high schools within the district. Following the initial analysis, a particular dataset from the Thompson High School provided for the 9th graders' performance was flagged under suspicious of falsified math and reading test results. As such, an additional analysis was performed, with the exclusion of the 9th graders' results.

## School Performance Analysis Results
A number of discrepancies was found between the original dataset and the control, no 9th graders, dataset.

* As can be seen from the pictures, the exclusion of Thomas's High School small sample of nine-graders' test results accounted for a slight decrease in the average reported math scores, overall percentage of students passing math and reading separately, as well as math and reading results combined.
